# Provider Compatibility Fix for darwin_arm64

The error you're encountering is related to the provider not being available for the darwin_arm64 platform (macOS on Apple Silicon). Here are some approaches to resolve this issue:

## Option 1: Use Development Overrides

Create a development override configuration for Terraform to use a locally built provider instead of trying to download it from the registry.

1. Create a `.terraformrc` file in your home directory (or append to it if it already exists):

```hcl
provider_installation {
  dev_overrides {
    "guardium-data-protection/gdp-middleware-helper" = "/path/to/your/terraform-provider-gdp-middleware-helper"
  }
  direct {}
}
```

2. Build the provider locally for your platform:

```bash
go build -o terraform-provider-gdp-middleware-helper
```

3. Try running the documentation generation again.

## Option 2: Skip Provider Verification for Documentation Generation

For documentation generation purposes only, you can use the `-providers-schema` flag to provide a pre-generated schema file instead of having the tool try to build and run the provider. Here's how:

1. First, create a providers schema file (you may need to do this on a compatible platform):

```bash
terraform providers schema -json > providers-schema.json
```

2. Then modify the tools/tools.go file to use this schema file. Change line 19 from:

```go
//go:generate go run github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs/cmd/tfplugindocs generate --provider-dir .. -provider-name gdp-middleware-helper
```

to:

```go
//go:generate go run github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs/cmd/tfplugindocs generate --provider-dir .. -provider-name gdp-middleware-helper --providers-schema ../providers-schema.json
```

3. Or run the command directly without modifying the file:

```bash
cd tools && go run github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs/cmd/tfplugindocs generate --provider-dir .. -provider-name gdp-middleware-helper --providers-schema ../providers-schema.json
```

Note: The `--skip-provider-verify` flag doesn't exist in the current version of tfplugindocs.

## Option 3: Cross-Compile the Provider

If you need to build the provider for multiple platforms, you can use cross-compilation:

```bash
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 go build -o terraform-provider-gdp-middleware-helper_v0.0.1
```

This will build the provider specifically for darwin_arm64 platform.

## Option 4: Update .goreleaser.yml

The .goreleaser.yml file already includes support for darwin_arm64, but you might need to build and publish a new release that includes this platform.

```bash
goreleaser release --snapshot --rm-dist
```

This will create a snapshot release that includes builds for all configured platforms.
